# Data Aggregation & Processing

## A. Centralized Data Aggregation

Use Logstash or Apache NiFi for data normalization:
1. Define parsers for incoming data.
2. Normalize into common fields:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "...",
  "tool": "SIEM/SOAR/etc.",
  "metric": "latency/uptime/error_count",
  "value": numeric/string,
  "severity": "critical/warning/info",
  "additional_info": {...}
}
```

## B. Real-Time Data Streaming (Optional but Recommended)

Deploy Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ as real-time streaming middleware.

### Steps to Stream Data:

1. Connect Kafka as a buffer between Logstash/NiFi and databases.
2. Ensure topics are organized by data type or source.
3. Configure backend service to consume Kafka streams and persist data to the database.
