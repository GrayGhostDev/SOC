# Alerting & Notifications Integration

## A. Define Alert Thresholds

Clearly define thresholds per KPI, for example:
- Latency > 300ms triggers "warning", > 500ms triggers "critical"
- Error rate > 5% triggers immediate "critical" alert

## B. Integrate with Alerting Tools

Set up integrations:
- PagerDuty, Opsgenie, Slack, MS Teams
- Automate notification triggers through backend APIs/webhooks.

### Steps for Automation:

1. Configure backend to evaluate data against thresholds.
2. Implement webhooks or REST integrations for automatic notifications to these platforms.
