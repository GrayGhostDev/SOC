# Security & Access Control

## A. Data Encryption

- Encrypt data-in-transit (TLS/HTTPS between clients and servers).
- Encrypt data at rest with AES-256 encryption (database-level encryption).

## B. Authentication & Authorization

Implement robust JWT/OAuth2 authentication.

Define roles (Admin, Analyst, Viewer):
- Admin: full access, customization, sensitive data.
- Analyst: moderate data view, configuration of dashboards.
- Viewer: basic read-only access, limited sensitive data exposure.

## C. Implementation Steps

1. Define role-based middleware to enforce permissions.
2. Validate API requests based on JWT/OAuth tokens.
3. Test role permissions thoroughly for data visibility and editing.
