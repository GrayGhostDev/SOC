# Interactive & User-Defined Views

## A. Implementing Time-Based Filtering

1. Add global date-picker and filters (severity, tool type) on dashboard UI.
2. Connect filter state management (e.g., React Context API) to visualization queries.
3. Integrate real-time backend queries respecting user-selected time filters.

## B. Drill-Down Capabilities

1. Define routes and detailed-view pages per SOC tool and alert.
2. Clicking a metric updates the page context with detailed data queries (logs, charts, events).
3. Maintain state in React to enable seamless navigation between views.
